/**
 * <p>
 * This timestamp adapter conforms to the HTTP 1.1 (RFC 1123) specification for reading and writing full dates in HTTP headers.
 * </p>
 * From the spec:<br>
 * HTTP applications have historically allowed three different formats for the representation of date/time stamps:
 * <p>
 *       Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123<br>
 *       Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036<br>
 *       Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format<br>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The first format is preferred as an Internet standard and represents a fixed-length subset of that defined by RFC 1123 [8]
 * (an update to RFC 822 [9]). The second format is in common use, but is based on the obsolete RFC 850 [12] date format and
 * lacks a four-digit year. HTTP/1.1 clients and servers that parse the date value MUST accept all three formats (for
 * compatibility with HTTP/1.0), though they MUST only generate the RFC 1123 format for representing HTTP-date values in header
 * fields. See section 19.3 for further information.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All HTTP date/time stamps MUST be represented in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), without exception. For the purposes of HTTP,
 * GMT is exactly equal to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). This is indicated in the first two formats by the inclusion of
 * "GMT" as the three-letter abbreviation for time zone, and MUST be assumed when reading the asctime format. HTTP-date is case
 * sensitive and MUST NOT include additional LWS beyond that specifically included as SP in the grammar.
 * </p>
 * Oh, by the way, this adapter also parses the default time stamp format output by TimestampAdapter and the default
 * date format output by DateAdapter.
